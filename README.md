# TOPIC MODELING USING NON NEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION(NMF)

> In this project we have performed Topic Modeling on unlabeled Quoras Questions dataset containing 
various questions.We have used an NMF approach for assingning topics to various questions.


## General Information

Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a mathematical method that takes a big table of numbers 
and tries to break it down into two smaller tables.

Here's how it works:

We start with a big table (matrix) filled with non-negative numbers (no negative values allowed). 
This table represents some data, like ratings of movies or brightness of pixels in an image.

NMF wants to find two smaller tables (matrices) that, when multiplied together, give us the original 
big table as closely as possible. One of these smaller tables represents important patterns or 
themes, and the other shows how much of each pattern is present in the original data.

The key is that both smaller tables must have non-negative numbers, just like the original data. This 
ensures that the patterns are easy to understand and interpret.

NMF uses a smart math trick to figure out these smaller tables. It tries different combinations of 
numbers until it gets the best fit and can recreate the original data as accurately as possible.

By finding these smaller tables, NMF reveals the main patterns and structures hidden in the big table. 
For example, if the big table was about movies, NMF might find patterns related to genres, and the 
smaller tables would tell us which movies belong to each genre.

The beauty of NMF is that it helps us simplify complex data and makes it easier to understand and analyze.

In summary, NMF is a mathematical method that finds two smaller tables from a big table of non-negative 
numbers. These smaller tables represent patterns and their strengths, helping us uncover hidden 
structures and make sense of the data.
